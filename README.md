### ATM Feature

The `ATM_Listener.java` class handles events related to ATMs. It includes methods to check if a block is an ATM, if a
player owns an ATM, and to find the closest hologram (likely used for displaying information at the ATM).

Players can interact with ATMs by clicking on them. This will open an interface to manage their personal bank accounts.

ATMs can only be destroyed and replaced by the bank's owner. There is a fixed limit to ATM placement, which can be
increased by purchasing additional slots in the relevant menu.
